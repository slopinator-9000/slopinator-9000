# 🚀 Slopinator-9000: Velocity Over Everything Else

> **An autonomous pipeline that ships ideas faster than you can think of them.**

> [!CAUTION]
> This is satire.

Slopinator is a self-driving system that discovers trending GitHub repositories, spins them into adjacent ideas, implements them with AI, publishes on GitHub, and announces them on X/Twitter—all in one relentless cycle.

**The mission:** Prove that velocity and iteration beat perfection and analysis paralysis.

## 🎯 What It Does (In 30 Seconds)

```
GitHub Trending Repos
        ↓
   Scout Oracle      (Find buildable patterns)
        ↓
   Idea Oracle       (Generate 3-5 adjacent ideas)
        ↓
   Research Oracle   (Headful Chrome validation)
        ↓
   Implementation    (Pi coding agent builds)
        ↓
   Deploy Oracle     (GitHub + NPM + CI)
        ↓
   Twitter Announcer (Ship the hype)
        ↓
    🎉 SHIPPED
```

**Each cycle:** ~2-12 hours from trending repo to deployed project.

## 🎪 The Slop Manifesto

This project celebrates **velocity-driven development**:

> *"A good idea shipped today is better than a perfect idea shipped next month."*

**We believe in:**
- 🏃 Speed of iteration over code perfection
- 🎯 Clear scope and ruthless prioritization
- 📦 Shipping MVPs and learning from production
- 🔄 Rapid feedback loops
- 🤖 Letting AI handle the heavy lifting

- 🎨 Making the messy middle visible

**What we ship:**
- ✨ Working software (mostly)
- 📝 Honest documentation
- 🧪 Reasonable test coverage (when time allows)
- 🎉 Personality and charm
- 🚀 Deployed and announced
- 📊 Full metrics and logs

**What we don't ship:**
- ❌ Analysis-paralysis

## 🎯 Status

**Active development** — New oracles, failure recovery improvements, and ideation strategies constantly being added.

This is the bleeding edge of velocity-driven autonomous development. Come watch the chaos unfold. 🚀

**Runs daily** — `0 22 * * * /usr/bin/slopinator-9000`
